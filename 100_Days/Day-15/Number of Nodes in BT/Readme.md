# Problem Description

Given a binary tree of size N, you have to count number of nodes in it. For example, count of nodes in below tree is 4.

            1
        /      \
     10          39
    /
    5

**Input** <br>
First line of input contains the number of test cases T. For each test case, there will be only a single line of input which is a string representing the tree as described below: 

The values in the string are in the order of level order traversal of the tree where, numbers denote node values, and a character “N” denotes NULL child.

For example:<br>

![example-gfg](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200124141533/Untitled-Diagram65.jpg)

For the above tree, the string will be: 1 2 3 N N 4 6 N 5 N N 7 N

**Output:** <br>
For each testcase in new line, print the number of nodes.

_Constraints:_ <br>
1 <= T <= 30 <br>
1 <= N <= 104 <br>

**Example:**

```
Input:
2
1 2 3
10 5 9 N 1 3 6 

Output:
3
6

Explanation:
Testcase 2: Given Tree is :
                                10
                              /    \
                              5      9
                               \    /  \
                                1  3    6
There are six nodes in the tree .
```
