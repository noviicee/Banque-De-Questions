# Poblem Description

## Maximum Subarray

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.
 

Example 1:

```txt
Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```

Example 2:

```txt
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
```

Example 3:

```txt
Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]
Output: 23
```

*Constraints:*

1 <= nums.length <= 105 <br>
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104 <br>
 
**Follow up:** <br>
If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.
